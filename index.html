                    Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet trea.
                    But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised throughout history for their antibaterial and medicinal properities.

                        Honey is a time-honered remedy  for a sore throat. According to one study, it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan (DM),
                        a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoon of honey with herbal tea or warm water an lemon.

                        Blood pressure is an important risk factor for jeafrt disease, and honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure.
                        Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.

                        Studies have shon that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholestoral by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. 
                        Honey may also ind=crease HDL (good) cholesteral by about 3%.

                        Honey congtains hydrogen peroxide, which may amount for some of its antibacterial properitioes. It also has a high sugar content, which can help stoip the growth of certian bacteria.
                        Additionally, honey has a low pH level. This works to pull mositure away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.

                                    company and have confidence in their ethical practices.
                                    I also used honey in my skincare routine and have been seeing big positive changes.
